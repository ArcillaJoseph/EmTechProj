        Predatory Governance, according to <strong>Rintel et al. (2022)</strong>, is when leaders use traditional moral values to rise in power, but later shift focus to personal or factional agendas, distorting policies, weakening institutions, and eroding accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        It devalues governance rules and affects equity, trust in leadership, and the integrity of public service systems.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Is Predatory Governance Happening in the Philippines?</h2>
      <p>
        Sadly, yes. Over recent years, corruption cases and political scandals have become common headlines. Misuse of the national budget, shady deals, and selective justice are clear markers of this pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted by <strong>Rintel and Fernandez (2020)</strong>, even national agencies like PhilHealth have been riddled with fraud, especially during times when resources were most needed — like the pandemic.

    <section>
      <h2>Why Is It Happening?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Resource Theory</strong> explains this through the competition for scarce public goods in low-trust societies. Politicians exploit systems to secure loyalty or wealth, sidelining real service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The logic of self-interest overrides civic duty, and without institutional checks, this culture spreads like wildfire.

    <section>
      <h2>What Can Be Done?</h2>
      <p>
        Transparency isn't just a buzzword — it's a weapon against corruption. Strengthening audit systems, digitalizing transactions, enforcing the Freedom of Information bill, and revisiting the 1987 Constitution are all vital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond laws, it's about citizens demanding more and holding leaders accountable. Every voice matters.

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Governance should never be a tool for personal gain. The Philippines, rich in culture and talent, deserves better. By promoting transparency, integrity, and accountability, we light the way toward a fairer and stronger nation.
